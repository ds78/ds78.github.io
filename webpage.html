			<h4>The Whale Shark Conservation Indonesia Project</h4>
			<p>The Whale Shark Indonesia Project (WSIP) is a team of young researchers, marine conservation professionals, and communication experts who work together to protect marine biodiversity with a focus on both the whale shark and its habitat. Most of our scientific research is focused on the whale shark population's genetics and distribution. Funded by the Conservation Leadership Programme's (CLP) 2015 Future Conservation Award and in collaboration with the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) Republic of Indonesia, the Bogor Agricultural University (IPB), and WWF-Indonesia, we organize training for local people to increase their expertise in monitoring the whale shark population in their own area. We plan to work closely with local stakeholders, mainly from the Center for Regional office of Coastal and Marine Resource (CRCMR), whose main responsibility is to conduct surveys of protected marine species, and oversee local universities to ensure knowledge transfer and continuation of the program at local level. In Aceh, we will work with Padang CRCMR and the University of Syiah Kuala. In Probolinggo, we will work with Denpasar CRCMR and Brawijaya University. In Talisayan, we will work together with Balikpapan CRCMR and Mulawarwan University. Lastly, in Parigi, we will work with Makassar CRCMR, Sam Ratulangi University and a local dive resort (Parigi Mountong Resort). Through a variety of media, we raise awareness on the importance of protecting whale sharks and respecting the marine environment.</p>
      <p> 
        Our team members are currently in Weh Island (Aceh), Jakarta, Bogor (West Java), and St Andrews (United Kingdom). Our study areas are where the sightings and strandings of whale sharks have been reported in Indonesian waters. In the western part of Indonesia, we will conduct a study in Weh Island, Aceh, and Probolinggo, East Java. Talisayan in East Kalimantan, and Parigi in Central Sulawesi will represent the data for the central part of Indonesia, while the previous work (by some of our team members) in Cenderawasih Bay in West Papua will do the eastern part. In Weh Island, Probolinggo and Parigi, whale shark aggregations have attracted tourists and possibly trigger the growth of tourism-related activities there. Meanwhile in Talisayan, the local government has been promoting their whale shark tourism since 2014. We hope our study in Talisayan and other study areas will provide more strong scientific based recommendations for the growth of sustainable and responsible tourism.To help our efforts you can send us pictures of whale sightings, donate to our cause, or sign up as a marine volunteer.</p>

			<h4>More about the Whale Shark</h4>
			<p>The whale shark, the largest fish in the world, has been listed as a vulnerable species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). In Indonesia, growing public interest in the whale shark was triggered by the discovery of the whale shark's affiliation with lift-net fisheries in Cenderawasih Bay, Papua, in 2006. The sharks often congregate around fish net platforms to suck fish out of the nets. A preliminary study that was conducted there became a foundation for the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) Republic of Indonesia to declare the whale shark as a fully protected fish in Indonesia by May 2013. However, there are still very few studies of the whale shark in Indonesia despite its endangered status and large size.</p>
